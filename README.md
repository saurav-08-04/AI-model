AI Model Projects
Overview
This repository showcases my work on various AI models developed using Google Colab. The projects focus on creating AI models with consistent facial features and eyes, as well as cartoon AI models. I continuously improve these models by placing them in different scenarios and refining their performance.

Projects
1. Consistent Face and Eyes AI Models
Description: Developed AI models that generate images with consistent facial features and eyes.

Tools Used: Google Colab, TensorFlow

Progress: Ongoing improvements to enhance model accuracy and versatility.



2. Cartoon AI Models
Description: Created AI models that generate cartoon-style images.

Tools Used: Google Colab, TensorFlow

Progress: Continuously refining the models to produce high-quality cartoon images.



Future Work
Scenario Placement: Working on placing AI-generated images in various scenarios to test and improve model performance.

Model Optimization: Enhancing the models for better accuracy and efficiency.
